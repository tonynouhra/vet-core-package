- Check for any behavioral changes

**Monthly Assessment:**
- Comprehensive performance analysis
- Security audit of artifact handling
- Review and update monitoring thresholds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: Artifact Not Found**
```
Error: Artifact 'artifact-name' not found
```
**Solution:** Verify the artifact name matches exactly between upload and download steps.

**Issue: Permission Denied**
```
Error: Permission denied when downloading artifact
```
**Solution:** Check workflow permissions and ensure proper GITHUB_TOKEN access.

**Issue: Timeout During Upload**
```
Error: Upload timed out after 10 minutes
```
**Solution:** Check artifact size and network connectivity. Consider splitting large artifacts.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Workflow Logs:**
   - Review detailed logs for upload/download steps
   - Look for specific error messages or warnings

2. **Verify Artifact Names:**
   - Ensure consistent naming between upload and download
   - Check for typos or case sensitivity issues

3. **Test Artifact Access:**
   - Verify artifacts are created and accessible
   - Check artifact retention settings

4. **Review Dependencies:**
   - Ensure job dependencies are correctly configured
   - Verify artifact passing between jobs
