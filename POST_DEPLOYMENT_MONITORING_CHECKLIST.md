# Post-Deployment Monitoring Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides comprehensive monitoring procedures to validate the successful deployment of GitHub Actions artifact upgrade from v3 to v4.

## Immediate Monitoring (0-4 hours)

### ✅ Workflow Execution Validation

**Priority: CRITICAL**

- [ ] **CI Workflow Status**
  - [ ] Trigger CI workflow manually: `gh workflow run ci.yml`
  - [ ] Verify workflow completes successfully
  - [ ] Check all jobs pass (test, security, build, integration-test)
  - [ ] Confirm artifacts are uploaded: `security-reports`, `dist`
  - [ ] Validate artifact download in integration-test job

- [ ] **Release Workflow Status**
  - [ ] Create test tag: `git tag v0.0.0-test && git push origin v0.0.0-test`
  - [ ] Monitor release workflow execution
  - [ ] Verify `release-dist` artifact creation
  - [ ] Check artifact downloads in TestPyPI and PyPI jobs
  - [ ] Confirm GitHub release creation works

- [ ] **Code Quality Workflow Status**
  - [ ] Trigger code quality workflow: `gh workflow run code-quality.yml`
  - [ ] Verify all quality checks complete
  - [ ] Check artifact uploads: security reports, dependency reports, benchmarks, coverage
  - [ ] Validate artifact accessibility in GitHub UI

### ✅ Artifact Integrity Checks

**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] **Artifact Upload Verification**
  ```bash
  # Check recent workflow runs
  gh run list --limit 5
  
  # Verify artifacts for latest run
  gh run view [RUN_ID] --log | grep -i artifact
  ```

- [ ] **Artifact Download Testing**
  ```bash
  # Download and verify artifacts
  gh run download [RUN_ID] --name dist
  gh run download [RUN_ID] --name security-reports
  
  # Verify file integrity
  ls -la dist/
  file dist/*
  ```

- [ ] **Cross-Job Artifact Passing**
  - [ ] Verify CI build artifacts are accessible to integration tests
  - [ ] Check release artifacts flow correctly through publication jobs
  - [ ] Confirm documentation artifacts deploy to GitHub Pages

### ✅ Error Log Analysis

**Priority: HIGH**

- [ ] **Workflow Log Review**
  ```bash
  # Check for artifact-related errors
  gh run view [RUN_ID] --log | grep -i "artifact\|upload\|download"
  
  # Look for new error patterns
  gh run view [RUN_ID] --log | grep -i "error\|fail\|warn"
  ```

- [ ] **Common Error Patterns to Watch**
  - [ ] "Artifact not found" errors
  - [ ] "Permission denied" messages
  - [ ] Timeout errors during upload/download
  - [ ] Compression or decompression failures
  - [ ] Network connectivity issues

## Short-term Monitoring (4-24 hours)

### ✅ Performance Metrics

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **Upload/Download Performance**
  - [ ] Measure artifact upload times (baseline: <2 minutes for typical artifacts)
  - [ ] Measure artifact download times (baseline: <1 minute for typical artifacts)
  - [ ] Compare with pre-upgrade performance metrics
  - [ ] Document any significant changes (>20% difference)

- [ ] **Workflow Duration Analysis**
  ```bash
  # Analyze workflow execution times
  gh run list --json conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 10 | \
    jq '.[] | {conclusion, duration: (.updatedAt | fromdateiso8601) - (.createdAt | fromdateiso8601)}'
  ```

- [ ] **Storage Usage Monitoring**
  - [ ] Check artifact storage consumption
  - [ ] Verify retention policies are working
  - [ ] Monitor for unexpected storage growth

### ✅ Comprehensive Workflow Testing

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **Documentation Workflow**
  - [ ] Trigger docs workflow: `gh workflow run docs.yml`
  - [ ] Verify documentation builds successfully
  - [ ] Check GitHub Pages deployment works
  - [ ] Validate API documentation coverage artifacts

- [ ] **Pre-Release Workflow**
  - [ ] Test pre-release workflow with sample version
  - [ ] Verify comprehensive testing completes
  - [ ] Check prerelease-dist artifact handling
  - [ ] Validate TestPyPI publication process

- [ ] **Maintenance Workflow**
  - [ ] Trigger maintenance workflow: `gh workflow run maintenance.yml`
  - [ ] Verify monthly audit artifacts are created
  - [ ] Check artifact cleanup functionality
  - [ ] Validate maintenance summary generation

### ✅ Integration Testing

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **End-to-End Pipeline Testing**
  - [ ] Create feature branch with test changes
  - [ ] Verify CI pipeline runs completely
  - [ ] Test pull request workflow integration
  - [ ] Confirm merge to main triggers appropriate workflows

- [ ] **External Integration Validation**
  - [ ] Check Codecov integration still works
  - [ ] Verify GitHub Pages deployment
  - [ ] Test PyPI/TestPyPI publication flow
  - [ ] Validate any third-party integrations

## Medium-term Monitoring (1-7 days)

### ✅ Stability Assessment

**Priority: MEDIUM**

- [ ] **Workflow Success Rate Analysis**
  ```bash
  # Calculate success rate over past week
  gh run list --json conclusion --limit 50 | \
    jq 'group_by(.conclusion) | map({conclusion: .[0].conclusion, count: length})'
  ```
  - [ ] Target: >95% success rate
  - [ ] Compare with pre-upgrade baseline
  - [ ] Investigate any degradation

- [ ] **Artifact Reliability Metrics**
  - [ ] Track artifact upload success rate
  - [ ] Monitor artifact download success rate
