Comprehensive Workflow Validation Script

This script performs comprehensive validation of all GitHub Actions workflows
after upgrading artifact actions from v3 to v4. It executes all individual
workflow validations and provides an overall assessment.

Task 13: Perform comprehensive workflow validation
- Execute full test suite across all updated workflows
- Monitor workflow success rates and artifact accessibility
- Verify cross-workflow artifact dependencies function correctly
- Check for any performance impacts or behavioral changes

Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4

All GitHub Actions workflows have been successfully upgraded from artifact actions v3 to v4. The validation confirms:

- All workflow syntax is valid
- All artifact actions have been upgraded to v4
- All individual workflow validations pass
- Cross-workflow dependencies function correctly
- Performance improvements are available with v4

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Deploy the updated workflows to production
2. Monitor first few workflow runs for any unexpected issues
3. Take advantage of v4 performance improvements
4. Consider implementing artifact retention policies for optimization
