# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The vet-core-package is the foundational Python package that provides shared data models, database utilities, and common schemas for the entire veterinary clinic platform. This package serves as the single source of truth for data structures and will be published to PyPI for consumption by all other services in the platform. It includes SQLAlchemy models for core entities, Pydantic schemas for validation, database connection utilities, and helper functions that ensure consistency across the distributed architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want a centralized core package with SQLAlchemy models, so that all services use consistent data structures and database schemas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is imported THEN it SHALL provide SQLAlchemy models for User, Pet, Appointment, Clinic, Veterinarian, and other core entities
2. WHEN models are defined THEN they SHALL include proper relationships, constraints, and indexes for optimal performance
3. WHEN the database schema is created THEN it SHALL support role-based access control with appropriate user types
4. WHEN models are used THEN they SHALL include audit fields (created_at, updated_at) for tracking changes
5. WHEN relationships are established THEN they SHALL use proper foreign keys and cascade behaviors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want Pydantic schemas for data validation, so that API requests and responses are properly validated and serialized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API data is processed THEN the package SHALL provide Pydantic schemas for request validation
2. WHEN responses are serialized THEN the package SHALL provide response schemas that exclude sensitive information
3. WHEN data validation occurs THEN schemas SHALL include proper field types, constraints, and custom validators
4. WHEN schemas are used THEN they SHALL support both create and update operations with appropriate field requirements
5. WHEN validation fails THEN schemas SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want database connection utilities, so that all services can connect to PostgreSQL consistently and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need database access THEN the package SHALL provide async SQLAlchemy engine configuration
2. WHEN connections are established THEN they SHALL support connection pooling for optimal performance
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN they SHALL use proper transaction management and error handling
4. WHEN multiple environments are used THEN connection utilities SHALL support different database configurations
5. WHEN services start up THEN database connections SHALL be established reliably with retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want common helper functions and utilities, so that repetitive operations are standardized across all services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN common operations are needed THEN the package SHALL provide utility functions for date/time handling
2. WHEN data processing occurs THEN utilities SHALL include functions for data transformation and formatting
3. WHEN validation is required THEN helper functions SHALL provide common validation patterns
4. WHEN errors occur THEN utilities SHALL include standardized error handling and logging functions
5. WHEN services need configuration THEN helpers SHALL provide environment variable management utilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want the package to be easily installable and versionable, so that services can depend on specific versions and updates can be managed systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL be properly structured for PyPI publication
2. WHEN versions are released THEN they SHALL follow semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
3. WHEN services install the package THEN they SHALL be able to specify version constraints
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the package SHALL have minimal external dependencies
5. WHEN the package is imported THEN it SHALL work correctly in both development and production environments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want comprehensive data models for the veterinary domain, so that all business entities are properly represented in the database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pet data is stored THEN models SHALL support pet profiles with breed, age, medical history, and owner relationships
2. WHEN appointments are managed THEN models SHALL support scheduling with veterinarian, clinic, and service type associations
3. WHEN clinic operations are tracked THEN models SHALL support multiple clinics with location, services, and staff relationships
4. WHEN user management is required THEN models SHALL support multiple user roles (pet owner, veterinarian, admin) with appropriate permissions
5. WHEN medical records are maintained THEN models SHALL support vaccination history, medication tracking, and health records

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want proper database migrations and schema management, so that database changes can be applied consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema changes are made THEN the package SHALL provide Alembic migration support
2. WHEN migrations are created THEN they SHALL be automatically generated from model changes
3. WHEN database upgrades occur THEN migrations SHALL be applied safely with rollback capabilities
4. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN migrations SHALL work consistently across development, staging, and production
5. WHEN data integrity is critical THEN migrations SHALL include proper constraints and validation checks

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform developer, I want the package to support testing and development workflows, so that services can be developed and tested efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN the package SHALL provide test utilities and fixtures
2. WHEN development occurs THEN the package SHALL support in-memory database testing
3. WHEN mock data is needed THEN utilities SHALL provide factory functions for creating test entities
4. WHEN integration testing occurs THEN the package SHALL support database cleanup and setup utilities
5. WHEN debugging is required THEN the package SHALL include proper logging and error reporting capabilities
